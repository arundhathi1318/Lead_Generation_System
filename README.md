**(Psst! Don't forget to check out the video walkthrough! Link at the bottom.)**

## üöÄ Features

*   **Sleek Lead Generation Form:** Collects Name, Email, Company (optional), and Message (optional) with client-side validation that's stricter than your grandma's cookie recipe.
*   **Pythonic Backend Power (Flask):** A lean, mean API that catches lead data, gives it a quick once-over, and yeets it over to n8n.
*   **n8n Workflow Automation:**
    *   Triggers on new lead submissions.
    *   Sends delightful email notifications to your sales team (so they can pounce!).
    *   (Optional but cool) Can be easily extended to store leads in Google Sheets, Airtable, or your favorite database.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:** Vite + React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript (because we're fancy)
*   **Backend:** Python, Flask (simple, effective, and snakes are cool)
*   **Automation:** n8n (your digital workflow butler)
*   **Email Service (via n8n):** SendGrid, Mailgun, SMTP (your choice!)
*   **Deployment:**
    *   Frontend: Vercel / Netlify
    *   Backend: Heroku / Render
    *   n8n: n8n Cloud / Local Docker

## üìã Prerequisites

Before you embark on this thrilling adventure, make sure you have:

1.  **Node.js & npm/yarn:** For the React frontend. Get it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
2.  **Python 3.x & pip:** For the Flask backend. Grab it from [python.org](https://python.org/).
3.  **An n8n Instance:**
    *   **n8n Cloud:** Easiest way to get started ([n8n.cloud](https://n8n.cloud/)).
    *   **Local Docker:** For the brave and self-hosty. See [n8n docs](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/installation/docker/).
4.  **An Email Service Account:** Like SendGrid, Mailgun, or access to an SMTP server. You'll need API keys/credentials for n8n.
5.  **A Code Editor:** VS Code is pretty neat.
6.  **Git:** Because version control is not just a suggestion, it's a lifestyle.
7.  **A Sense of Humor:** This is mandatory.
